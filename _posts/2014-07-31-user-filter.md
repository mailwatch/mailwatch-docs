## Per Domain/Per User Filtering

MailWatch for MailScanner 1.0 has implemented new filtering capabilities to be able to support per-domain filtering or per-user filtering more effectively than previously.

To utilise this new functionality - all you need to do is create MailWatch users named by either their domain or their e-mail address and set their user type accordingly.

For example:

* If you create a user named `johndoe@example.com` as user type `User` and I log-in as that user, I will only be able to see e-mail address to/from me and to be able to add Blacklist/Whitelist entries for my address (if enabled).
* If you create a user named `domain-admin@example.com` as type `Domain Administrator` and I log-in as that user, I will only be able to see messages to/from my domain or create blacklist/whitelist entries for the entire domain or for a specific user. The domain in the mail address (part after `@`) will be used to identify the users domain. If username is not in format of a mail address this assumes the domain "no domain" and the domain admin will only be able to edit/see users that also have "no domain".
* The `Administrator` type can do anything for any user or domain.
* If you need to have _aliases_ for your users - e.g. `johndoe@example.com` also has an e-mail alias `j.doe@example.org`, then no problem - use the **Filters** screen to add `j.doe@example.org` and the `johndoe@example.com` user will be able to see both.

Easy!
