##Getting Started

You must have a working MailScanner set-up and have running copies of:

- MySQL
- Apache or nginx
- PHP (with MySQL and GD support)

And for MailScanner CustomConfig modules to be able to use a database, you need:

- Perl
- DBI
- DBD-MySQL

You also need Perl Encoding::FixLatin to deal with email subjects that contain characters in more than one encoding.

Please read through the installation/upgrading instructions in their entirety before proceeding.
